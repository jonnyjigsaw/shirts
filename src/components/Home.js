import React from 'react'


const Home = () => (
<div>
  <h1> Welcome to this Home Page </h1>

  <h2>This is an example site with create-react-app, redux, react-router and material UI components.</h2>

  <p>It may not be perfect as I'm still learning how to implement this. Specifically I'm not sure on my redux practices, right now I've bound the actions to the "SideDrawer" and also the "App", they both contain components that I need to pass actions in to open/close the "Drawer" navigation bar.</p>


</div>

)

export default Home
